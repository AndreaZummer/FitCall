## What is FitCall?

FitCall is a React-based application designed to help users create personalized workout routines by leveraging a database of exercises. After logging in, users can browse through a range of exercises to find what they prefere. The app offers multiple features to enhance the user experience, including: 

Customizable Workouts: Users can create workouts based on their preferences. The app allows users to set parameters such as:

- Body Part: Focus on specific body areas (e.g., arms, legs).
- Time: Define the workout duration.
- Difficulty: Select the desired intensity of the workout (e.g., beginner, intermediate, advanced).
